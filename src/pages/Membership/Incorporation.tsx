        How to Incorporate
      </h2>

      <p>
        A corporation is a legal entity that can do anything a person can do.
        Think of it as an artificial person. It can buy and sell real estate,
        bring a lawsuit and be sued, or anything else that a natural person can
        do. Unlike a person, though, a corporation has perpetual life, which
        means it can go on forever. There are many types of corporations in
        business: publicly held corporations, domestic corporations, foreign
        corporations, for-profit corporations, non-profit corporations, limited
        liability corporations, and private corporations, to name a few.
        Regardless of the type, perhaps the greatest advantage of a corporation
        is limited liability.

        Lambda Psi Rho, Incorporated
      </h2>

      <p>
        To be incorporated, it is required that each chapter, including the
        alumni chapter, to be active, registered corporation in the state where
        they are located. We are also a registered non-profit organization.
        Generally, there will be one corporation for each Lambda Psi Rho
        chapter. The name of the corporation will be something as followed
        “Lambda Psi Rho Fraternity, Inc. of the University of Nevada, Reno” In
        some cases, there may be a need for separate corporations for the
        collegiate chapters and other chapters following, however, this is
        uncommon.

        How To Become a Corporation
      </h2>

      <p>
        Incorporation is the process of becoming a corporation in your state.
        Since the process varies from state to state, you will need further
        clarification for your situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here are the general steps that you need to follow: Every state has
        a department, usually part of the Secretary of State, that is
        responsible for corporations. Contact this department to see what the
        requirements are for starting a tax-exempt corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are probably going to need:
        <ul className="list-decimal ml-4">
          <li> Corporation Name. Articles of Incorporation.</li>
          <li>
            This document states the purpose of the corporation, the original
            incorporators, the life of the corporation, and how the corporate
            assets are disposed of when the corporation closes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registered Agent. The registered agent must be a responsible adult
            in your state who can be served legal notices.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Send a copy of your state certificate of incorporation to the National
        board so that it can be filed in your chapter's permanent file. Complete
        and file Form SS-4 with the Internal Revenue Service in order to receive
        your Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN). Send this number to
        the Offices of the Grand Chapter so we can add your FEIN to our
        subordinate group list so that you will be exempt from federal taxes.
        This FEIN is the number you need in order to open a checking account at
        a local bank.

        Maintaining Corporate Status and becoming a Non-Profit Organization
      </h2>

      <p>
        Usually, you will be required to file an annual report and pay an annual
        fee in order to maintain registration as an active, tax-exempt
        corporation. Use this FEIN to also become a non-profit organization
        through your Secretary of State website.
