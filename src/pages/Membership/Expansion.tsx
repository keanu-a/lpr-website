        How to Start?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Getting in contact with our head of expansion is the first step. We are
        open to all inquires, so please do not hesitate. Each school is unique
        and have different requirements to begin a club/group/organization. So
        we ask that you do a little research on how you can begin such group on
        your campus. From there, we will assist you in the steps on establishing
        chapter status through national recognition. From interest group to
        colony, to chapter status, it is the goal that you get national
        recognition by means of chapter status. Due note that since each campus
        has different requirements and procedures, that we also reserve the
        right to alter parts of the expansion process to meet our constitutional
        requirements and those requirements. With that being said, we recommend
        a group of determined young men to begin the expansion process, who can
        maintain good academic standing in accordance to their respective campus
        rules.
